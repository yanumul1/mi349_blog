    My name is Chandrashekhar Yanumula and I am an. information science major at Michigan State University. This blog is meant to help those in need of Fantasy Football advice for this ongoing 2025-26 NFL season. I combined my passion of enjoying sports in my free time and experience with technology to write concise weekly recaps and lineup suggestions for the public to use. In addition to learning HTML, I created this blog to discuss with friends and other students my weekly lineup suggestions and fantasy starts for this season. I've been a fantasy sports fan for years dating back to my freshman year of college where I took my passion of sports more seriously with the free time I had in college. With my experiences over the years of watching sports this made me research recent player matches, projections, and statistical trends throughout the NFL as well as NBA season. Apart from fantasy, I have hobbies that I have listed down below!
