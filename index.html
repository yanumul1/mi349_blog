      <h2>Why You Must Start Caleb Williams This Week</h2>

        Williams has shown to be a reliable QB towards the end of his rookie campaign last season. So far he has been great in the opening weeks of the season, showing both skill and potential as a fantasy quarterback. During the first three games of this season, he has shown his athleticism, decision-making, and ability to read the defense, showcasing his awareness. Even if his passing efficiency fluctuated from week to week, his ability to move around the pocket has allowed him to extend plays and make an impact both on the ground and in the passing game. His ability to be a pocket passer and a reliable rusher makes him very reliable in fantasy leagues that award players for completing positive yardage each and every drive. Furthermore, Williams and his receivers have grown increasingly reliable as his primary targets, the rising star quarterback has found Rome Odunze, the ninth overall choice in the 2024 draft, to be a consistent target. This has resulted in plenty of major plays and important completions that have kept his team competitive. For fantasy managers who are worried about risk, turnovers have been low in comparison to last year. In important scenarios, he has stood out due to being able to efficiently manage the game and establish scoring opportunities. His early-season play shows that he can succeed at this level, and his growth under Ben Johnson's new coaching staff speaks well for additional success in the coming stages of the season.

        Caleb Williams is an excellent option to start as your fantasy quarterback in Week 4. This week, he takes on the Las Vegas Raiders, a team that has given up some huge plays and struggled to stop the passing attack. With this matchup, Williams has a good chance of scoring a lot of fantasy points through passing and his occasional yards gained by rushing. Because of his dual threat ability, managers can take advantage of several scoring options, which is always helpful in deeper leagues where every point counts. Williams is expected to throw for about 265 yards, two passing touchdowns, and maybe one interception, according to fantasy analysts. Fantasy point potential is high according to these projections, especially in leagues that reward throwing and overall yardage. Williams has an advantage over other quarterbacks because the Raiders defense is ranked in the bottom half of the league. His potential for explosive plays is increased because their defense has given up huge plays and points through the air. Additionally, Williams' mobility, which allows him to gain more rushing yards and possibly even score rushing touchdowns in the event that the pocket collapses. In addition, the offensive line has improved in comparison to last season, which has given him more time to make accurate throws.

     As you can see, Caleb Williams' performances so far have improved week by week. There is no guaranteed he will have a passer rating of 142.5 or higher but I expect it to be just over 92.
