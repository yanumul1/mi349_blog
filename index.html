        In the first few weeks of the season, Caleb Williams has stood out, showing both skill and promise as a fantasy quarterback. His decision-making, athleticism, and ability to recognize the defense have all been exceptional over the first three games of the 2025-26 season. His ability to move around the pocket has allowed him to extend plays and contribute both on the ground and in the air, even though his throwing efficiency varied from week to week. He is especially useful in fantasy leagues that award rushing yards and touchdowns because of his dual-threat ability. Additionally, Williams and his receivers have become more reliable as his main target, Rome Odunze the ninth overall pick in the 2024 draft has been a trustworthy target for the rising star quarterback. This has resulted in plenty of major plays and important completions that have kept his team competitive. For fantasy managers who are worried about risk, turnovers have been low in comparison to last year. His ability to plan scoring opportunities and effectively control the game has made him stand out in key circumstances. His early-season performances suggest that he is able to play at this level, and his development under his brand new coaching staff led by Ben Johnson speaks well for more success later in the season.

        Caleb Williams is an excellent option to start as your fantasy quarterback in Week 4. This week, he takes on the Las Vegas Raiders, a team that has given up some huge plays and struggled to stop the passing attack. With this matchup, Williams has a good chance of scoring a lot of fantasy points through passing and his occasional yards gained by rushing. Because of his dual threat ability, managers can take advantage of several scoring options, which is always helpful in deeper leagues where every point counts. Williams is expected to throw for about 265 yards, two passing touchdowns, and maybe one interception, according to fantasy analysts. Fantasy point potential is high according to these projections, especially in leagues that reward throwing and overall yardage. Williams has an advantage over other quarterbacks because the Raiders defense is ranked in the bottom half of the league. His potential for explosive plays is increased because their defense has given up huge plays and points through the air. Additionally, Williams' mobility, which allows him to gain more rushing yards and possibly even score rushing touchdowns in the event that the pocket collapses. In addition, the offensive line has improved in comparison to last season, which has given him more time to make accurate throws.

     As you can see, Caleb Williams performances so far have improved week by week. There is no guaranteed he will have a passer rating of 142.5 or higher but I expect it to be just over 92.
